Heaven Is in the palm of my hand And it's waiting here for you What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy?  If I close my eyes forever Will it all remain unchanged? If I close my eyes forever Will it all remain the same?  Sometimes It's hard to hold on So hard to hold on to my dreams It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me  Like a dagger You stick me in the heart And taste the blood from my blade And when we sleep, would you shelter me in your warm and darkened grave?  If I close my eyes forever Will it all remain unchanged? If I close my eyes forever Will it all remain the same?  Will you ever take me? "No, I just can't take the pain" But would you ever trust me? "No, I'll never feel the same"  I know I've been so hard on you I know I've told you lies If I could have just one more wish I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes  If I close my eyes forever Will it all remain unchanged? If I close my eyes forever Will it all remain the same? Oh no  "Close your eyes Close your eyes You gotta close your eyes for me"

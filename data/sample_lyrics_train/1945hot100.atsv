36@Frank Sinatra@Try a Little Tenderness@INTRO: In the hustle of the day, we're all inclined to miss Little things that mean so much A word, a smile, and a kiss When a woman loves a man, he's a hero in her eyes And a hero he can always be if he'll just realize  She may be weary, women do get weary Wearing the same shabby dress And when she's weary, try a little tenderness  She may be waiting, just anticipating Things she may never possess While she's without them, try a little tenderness  It's not just sentimental, she has her grief and her care But a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear  You won't regret it, women don't forget it Love is their whole happiness And it's all so easy, try a little tenderness

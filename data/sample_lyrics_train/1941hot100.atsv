5@Jimmy Dorsey@Amapola (Pretty Little Poppy)@A boy found a dream upon a distant shore A maid with a way of whispering"Si, senor."

14@Jimmy Dorsey@Blue Champagne@Blue Champagne - purple shadows and Blue Champagne, With the echoes that still remain I keep a blue rendezvous. Bubbles rise like a fountain before my eyes And they suddenly crystallize to form a vision of you.  All the plans we started, all the songs we sang Each little dream we knew seem to overtake me like a boomerang.  Blue is the sparkle, gone is the tang; Each old refrain keeps returning as I remain With my memories and Blue Champagne To toast the dream that was you.

21@The Sons of the Pioneers@Cool Water@All day I face the barren waste without the taste of water, Cool water. Old Dan and I with throats burned dry and souls that cry for water, Cool water.  The night are cool and I'm a fool each stars a pool of water, Cool water. But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn and carry on to water, Cool water.  Keep a movin' Dan, don't you listen to him Dan, he's a devil not a man And he spreads the burnin' sand with water. Dan can't you see that big green tree where the waters runnin' free And it's waiting there for me and you. Water, cool water.  The shadows sway and seem to say tonight we pray for water, Cool water. And way up there He'll hear our prayer and show us where there's water, Cool Water.  Dan's feet are sore he's yearning for just one thing more than water, Cool water. Like me, I guess, he'd like to rest where there's no quest for water, Cool water.

My darling, hold me tight And whisper to me Then soft through a starry night I'll hear a rhapsody

25@Vera Lynn@A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square@When two lovers meet in Mayfair So the legands tell Songbirds sing and winter turns to spring Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the spell I know such enchantment can be 'cause it happened one evening to me  That certain night, the night we met, there was magic abroad in the air, There were angels dining at the Ritz and  A Nightingale Sang In Berkley Square I may be right, I may be wrong, but I'm perfectly willing to swear That when you turn'd and smiled at me A Nightingale Sang In Berkley Square  The moon that lingered over London town; poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown How could he know we two were so in love, the whole darn world seemed upside down The streets of town were paved with stars, it was such a romantic affair, And as we kissed and said goodnight, A Nightingale Sang In Berkley Square  Our homeward step was just as light as the tap dancing feet of Astair And like an echo far away, A Nightingale Sang In Berkley Square I know 'cause I was there, that night in Berkley Square

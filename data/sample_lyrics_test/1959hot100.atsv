71@Wink Martindale@Deck Of Cards@NARRATIVE: During the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer, the text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, "Soldier, put away those cards." After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the Provost Marshall.  The Marshall said, "Sergeant, why have you brought this man here?" "For playing cards in church, Sir." "And what have you to say for yourself, son?" "Much, Sir," replied the soldier. The Marshall said, "I hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever punished." The soldier said, "Sir, I have been on the march for about six days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my intentions." And with that, the boy started his story:  "You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew,   Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I see the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year. There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter. So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a Prayer Book."  "And friends, the story is true. I know, I was that soldier."

97@Everly Brothers@Take A Message To Mary@These are the words of a frontier lad Who lost his love when he turned bad  Take a message to Mary But don't tell her where I am Take a message to Mary But don't say I'm in a jam You can tell her I had to see the world Or tell her that my ship set sail You can say she better not wait for me But don't tell her I'm in jail Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail  Take a message to Mary But don't tell her what I've done Please don't mention the stagecoach And the shot from a careless gun You can tell her I had to change my plans And cancel out the wedding day But please don't mention my lonely cell Where I'm gonna pine away Until my dying day  Take a message to Mary But don't tell her all you know My heart's aching for Mary Lord knows I miss her so Just tell her I went to Timbuktu Tell her I'm searching for gold You can say she better find someone new To cherish and to hold Oh, Lord, this cell is cold  Mary, Mary Oh, Lord this cell is cold
98@Mormon Tabernacle Choir@Battle Hymn Of The Republic@Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored, He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword His truth is marching on.  CHORUS: Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.  I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps His day is marching on.  CHORUS  I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish'd rows of steel,   "As ye deal with my condemners, So with you my grace shall deal;" Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel Since God is marching on.  CHORUS  He has sounded form the trumpet that shall never call retreat He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! Our God is marching on.  CHORUS  ln the beauty of the lillies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me: As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, While God is marching on.  CHORUS

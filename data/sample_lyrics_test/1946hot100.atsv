7@Johnny Mercer@Personality@When Madame Pompadour was on a ballroom floor Said all the gentlemen,"Obviously," "The madame has the cutest personality."  And think of all the books about Du Barry's looks What was it made her the toast of Paris? She had a well-developed personality  (What did Romeo see in Juliet?) (Or Figaro in Figarette?) (Or Jupiter in Juno?) You know!  And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced No doubt it must have been easy to see That she knew how to use her personality  (A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well) (And never sit on the boss' left knee) (Unless she's got a perfect personality)  (A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair) (Or even just a bit bowed at the knee) (If she can show a faultless personality)  Why are certain girls offered certain things Like sable coats and wedding rings? By men who wear their spats right? (That's right!)  (So don'tcha say I'm smart and have the kindest heart (Or what a wonderful sister I'd be) Just tell me how you like my Rufff!! (Personality)  Baby, you've got the cutest Personality

Folks like us, Could never fuss, With schools and books and learnin', Still we've gone from A to Z, Doin' what comes naturally.  You don't have to know, How to read or write, When you're out with a feller, In the pale moonligt, You don't have to look, At a book to find, What he thinks of the moon, And what is on his mind, That comes naturally.  My uncle out in Texas, Can't even write his name, He signs his checks with "X's", But they cash 'em just the same. If you saw my Paw and Maw, You'd know they had no learnin', Still they raised a family, Doin' what comes naturally, Doin' what comes naturally!

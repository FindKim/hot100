9@Billy Joel@It's Still Rock And Roll To Me@What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing? "Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?" Maybe I should buy some old tab collars? "Welcome back to the age of jive.  Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey? You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money." Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me  What's the matter with the car I'm driving? "Can't you tell that it's out of style?" Should I get a set of white wall tires? "Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?  Nowadays you can't be too sentimental Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental." Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk It's still rock and roll to me  Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers 'Cause it's always been the same old scene There's a new band in town But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine Aimed at your average teen  How about a pair of pink sidewinders And a bright orange pair of pants? "You could really be a Beau Brummel baby If you just give it half a chance.  Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers." Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me  (Alright, Rico) Wooh, wooh  Ooh, what's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? "Don't you know that they're out of touch?" Should I try to be a straight A student? "If you are then you think too much.  Don't you know about the new fashion honey? All you need are looks and a whole lotta money." It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me  Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me
10@Bette Midler@The Rose@Some say love, it is a river That drowns the tender reed Some say love, it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed  Some say love, it is a hunger An endless aching need I say love, it is a flower And you, its only seed  It's the heart afraid of breaking That never learns to dance It's the dream afraid of waking That never takes the chance  It's the one who won't be taken Who cannot seem to give And the soul, afraid of dyin' That never learns to live  When the night has been too lonely And the road has been too long That you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong  Just remember in the winter Far beneath the bitter snows Lies the seed that with the sun's love In the spring becomes the rose

34@Kenny Rogers@Coward Of The County@Evryone considered him the coward of the county. Hed never stood one single time to prove the county wrong. His mama named him tommy, the folks just called him yellow, But something always told me they were reading tommy wrong.  He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison. I looked after tommy cause he was my brothers son. I still recall the final words my brother said to tommy: Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun.  Promise me, son, not to do the things Ive done. Walk away from trouble if you can. It wont mean youre weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope youre old enough to understand: Son, you dont have to fight to be a man.  Theres someone for evryone and tommys love was becky. In her arms he didnt have to prove he was a man. One day while he was workin the gatlin boys came callin. They took turns at becky.... there was three of them!  Tommy opened up the door and saw his becky cryin. The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand. He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddys picture. As his tears fell on his daddys face, he heard these words again:  Promise me, son, not to do the things Ive done. Walk away from trouble if you can. It wont mean youre weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope youre old enough to understand: Son, you dont have to fight to be a man.  The gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom. One of them got up and met him halfway cross the floor. When tommy turned around they said, hey look! ol yellows leavin. But you coulda heard a pin drop when tommy stopped and blocked the door.  Twenty years of crawlin was bottled up inside him. He wasnt holdin nothin back; he let em have it all. When tommy left the barroom not a gatlin boy was standin. He said, this ones for becky, as he watched the last one fall. And I heard him say,  I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done. I walk away from trouble when I can. Now please dont think Im weak, I didnt turn the other cheek, And papa, I sure hope you understand: Sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man.  Evryone considered him the coward of the county.

1@Barbra Streisand@The Way We Were@Memories Light the corners of my mind Misty watercolor memories Of the way we were  Scattered pictures Of the smiles we left behind Smiles we gave to one another For the way we were  Can it be that it was all so simple then Or has time rewritten every line? If we had the chance to do it all again Tell me, would we? Could we?  Memories May be beautiful and yet What's too painful to remember We simply to choose to forget  So it's the laughter We will remember Whenever we remember The way we were The way we were  Mmm, mmm Mmm
2@Terry Jacks@Seasons In The Sun@Goodbye to you my trusted friend We've known each other since we were nine or ten Together we've climbed hills and trees Learned of love and ABCs Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees  Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Pretty girls are everywhere Think of me and I'll be there  We had joy, we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the hills that we climbed Were just seasons out of time  Goodbye papa, please pray for me I was the black sheep of the family You tried to teach me right from wrong Too much wine and too much song Wonder how I got along  Goodbye papa, it's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Little children everywhere When you see them, I'll be there  We had joy, we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons, have all gone  We had joy, we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons, have all gone  Goodbye Michelle, my little one You gave me love and helped me find the sun And every time that I was down You would always come around And get my feet back on the ground  Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air With the flowers everywhere I wish that we could both be there  We had joy, we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the stars we could reach Were just starfish on the beach  We had joy, we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the stars we could reach Were just starfish on the beach  We had joy, we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons, have all gone  All our lives we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the hills that we climbed Were just seasons out of time  We had joy, we had fun We had seasons in the sun

46@Paper Lace@The Night Chicago Died@Daddy was a cop on the east side of Chicago Back in the USA, back in the bad old days  In the heat of a summer night In the land of the dollar bill When the town of Chicago died And they talk about it still When a man named Al Capone Tried to make that town his own And he called his gang to war With the forces of the law  I heard my momma cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother, what a night it really was? Brother, what a fight it really was? Glory be!  I heard my momma cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother, what a night the people saw? Brother, what a fight the people saw? Yes, indeed  And the sound of the battle rang Through the streets of the old East Side Till the last of the hoodlum gang Had surrendered up or died There was shouting in the street And the sound of running feet And I asked someone who said " 'Bout a hundred cops are dead".  I heard my momma cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother, what a night it really was? Brother, what a fight it really was? Glory be!  I heard my momma cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother, what a night the people saw? Brother, what a fight the people saw? Yes, indeed  Then there was no sound at all But the clock upon the wall Then the door burst open wide And my daddy stepped inside And he kissed my momma's face And he brushed her tears away  The night Chicago died Na-na na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na The night Chicago died Brother, what a night the people saw Brother, what a fight the people saw Yes, indeed  The night Chicago died Na-na na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na The night Chicago died Brother, what a night it really was Brother, what a fight it really was Glory be!

93@Jim Stafford@Wildwood Weed@The wildwood flower grew wild on the farm, And we never knowed what it was called. Some said it was a flower and some said it was weed, I never gave it much thought ...... One day I was out there talking to my brother, Reached down for a weed to chew on, Things got fuzzy and things got blurry, And then everything was gone! Didnt know what happened, But I knew it beat the hell out of sniffin burlap.  I come to and my brother was there, And he said, Whats wrong with your eyes? I said, I dont know, I was chewing on a weed. He said, Let me give it a try. We spent the rest of that day and most of that night, Trying to find my brother, Bill. Caught up with him, bout six oclock the next morning, Naked, swinging on the wind mill! He said he flew up there. I had to fly up there and bring him down, He was about half crazy .....  The very next day we picked a bunch of them weeds, And put em in the sun to dry. Then we mashed em up and chopped em up, And put em in the corncob pipe. Smokin that wildwood flower got to be a habit, We didnt see no harm. We thought it was kind of handy, Take a trip and never leave the farm!  All good things gotta come to an end, And its the same with the wildwood weed. One day this feller from Washington came by, And he spied it and turned white as a sheet. Then they dug and they burned, And they burned and they dug, And they killed all our cute little weeds. Then they drove away, We just smiled and waved .......... Sittin there on that sack of seeds!  Y'all come back now, hear?

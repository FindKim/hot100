35@Clarence Carter@Patches@I was born and raised down in Alabama On a farm way back up in the woods I was so ragged the folks used to call me "Patches" Papa used to tease me about it 'Course deep down inside he was hurt 'Cause he'd done all he could  My papa was a great old man I can see him with a shovel in his hand See, education he never had He did wonders when the time got bad  The little money from the crops he raised Barely paid the bills we made  Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground When he tried to get up life would kick him back down One day papa called me to his dyin' bed Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said He said:  "Patches, I'm depending on you son To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you"  Two days later papa passed away And I became a man that day So I told mama I was gonna quit school But she said that was daddy's strictest rule  So every morning fore I went to school I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on I wanted to leave, just run away from home  But I would remember what my daddy said With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed He said:  "Patches, I'm depending on you son I've tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest"  Then one day a strong rain came And washed all the crops away And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying The weight of the whole world on my shoulders And you know, mama knew what I was going through  'Cause every day I had to work the fields 'Cause that's the only way we got our meals See, I was the oldest of the family And everybody else depended on me  Every night I heard my mama pray: "Lord, give him strength to make another day"  Though years have passed and all the kids have grown The angels took mama to a brand new home Lord knows, people, I shedded tears But my daddy's voice helped me through the years Sayin':  "Patches, I'm depending on you son To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you"  Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':  "Patches, I'm depending on you son I've tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest"  I could still hear papa when he's saying:  "Patches, I'm depending on you, son To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you"

94@Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young@Woodstock@Well, I came upon a child of God He was walking along the road And I asked him, "tell me, where are you going?" This he told me  Said, "I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm Gonna join in a rock and roll band Got to get back to the land And set my soul free"  We are stardust, we are golden We are billion-year-old carbon And we've got to get ourselves Back to the garden  Well, then can I walk beside you? I have come to lose the smog And I feel myself a cog In somethin' turning  And maybe it's the time of year Yes, and maybe it's the time of man And I don't know who I am But life is for learning  We are stardust, we are golden We are billion-year-old carbon And we got to get ourselves Back to the garden  We are stardust, we are golden We are billion-year-old carbon And we got to get ourselves Back to the garden  By the time we got to Woodstock We were half a million strong And everywhere was a song And a celebration  And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes Riding shotgun in the sky Turning into butterflies Above our nation  We are stardust, we are golden We are caught in the devil's bargain And we got to get ourselves Back to the garden

I, I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How can a person like me care for you?

I, why do I bother
When you're not the one for me?
(Ooh)
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
(But where do you belong?)

I, under the pale moon
For so many years I wondered
Who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?

Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
(Ooh)
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
(But where do you belong?)

Oh, oh oh

I saw the sign
And it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you
I've left you, oh, oh oh oh

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong

(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)
I saw the sign

I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side

I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part

'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I made mistakes
I'll never break your heart

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
I'll be there
I swear like a shadow that's by your side
I'll be there

For better or worse
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear, ooh

I'll give you every thing I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls

And when(and when)there's silver in your hair
You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as the time turns the page
My love won't age at all

And I swear(I swear)by the moon and the stars in the skies
I'll be there(I'll be there)

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Oh oh

Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone tear them away
Hold on, there will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you

(Chorus)

If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear "I love you" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand... if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again

And I can't stop thinking about
About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinking about
About the love that you made to me
And I can't get you out of my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away?
And I can't stop caring about
About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doing without
Without the center of my life
And I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again

(Chorus)

And I can't stop thinking about
About the way my life would be
No, I can't stop thinking about
How could you love me then leave?
And I can't get you out of my mind
God knows how hard I've tried
And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die
And I can't stop doing without
Without the wailing of my heart
No, I can't stop doing without
For I would surely fall apart
And I can't get you out of my mind
And I know I can't deny it
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again

When it's love you give
I'll be a man of good faith
then in love you live.
I'll make a stand. I won't break
I'll be the rock you can build on,
be there when you're old,
to have and to hold.

When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
then there's a reason why.
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you
from the wind and the rain,
from the hurt and pain.

Let's make it all for one and all for love.
Let the one you hold be the one you want,
The one you need,
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love.

When it's love you make
I'll be the fire in your night.
When it's love you take.
I will defend, I will fight
I'll be there when you need me.
And honor's at stake,
This vow I will make

That it's all for one and all for love.
Let the one you hold be the one you want,
The one you need.
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love.

Don't lay our love to rest
Cause we can stand up to the test.
We got everything, that and more
Then we had planned,
More than the rivers that run the land.
We've got it all, in our hands.

Now it's all for one and all for love.
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need,
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know
then just let your feelings show.
When there's someone that you want,
when there's someone that you need
Let's make it all, all for one and all for love.

She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morninglight
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought:
"Oh, what a morning"

It's not a day for work, ah
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants

All that she wants

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's a hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever

It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

Ohohoho

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy

I will survive without you

Don't tell me that you wanna leave

If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go, darling
Maybe it's better that way

I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine

Just walk out that door
Yeah, see if I care
Go on and go now, but

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry

Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

I won't let you know

I won't miss your arms around me
Holding me tight (Holding me tight)
If you ever think about me
Just know that I'll be alright (I'll be alright)

I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine

I know I'll survive
Sure I'll make it through
And I'll even learn to live without you

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry

Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

I wish I could scream out loud that I love you
I wish I could say to you: "Don't go"

As he walks away he feels the pain getting strong
People in your life they don't know what's going on
Too proud to turn around
He's gone

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry

Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go

Baby, don't turn around!

I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you again

Yeah, yeah (Oooo)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, "That's not it"
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

Believe in all the things that you tell...
I would sure like to believe you, my heart wants to receive you;
Just make me know that you are sincere...

You know I'd love for you to lead me, and follow through completely,
So won't you give me all I ask for?
And if you give your very best to bring me happiness,
I'll show you just how much I adore you..

'Cause you mean the world to me, you are my everything;
I swear the only thing that matters, matters to me...
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby!
'Cause you mean so much to me, oh...

Now it's gonna take some workin', but I believe you're worth it,
Long as your intentions are good, so good...
There is just one way to show it, and boy, I hope you know it;
That no one can love you like I could...

Lord knows I want to trust you, and oh, baby, how I love you;
I'm not sure if love is enough...
And I will not be forsaken, and I hope there's no mistakin',
So tell me that you'll always be true...

'Cause you mean so much to me... (You mean so much to me, so much, baby... Oh, yeah, darlin'...)

There's a feeling in my heart that I know I can't escape,
So please don't let me fall, don't let it be too late...
There's a time when words are good, then they just get in the way,
So show me how you feel - Baby, I'm for real;
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...

'Cause you mean the world to me, you are my everything;
I swear the only thing that matters, matters to me... (Oh, oh, oh...)
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby! (Oh, yeah...)
'Cause you mean so much to me... (Hear me, darlin', you...)

You mean the world to me, you are my everything; (Every, every, everything...)
I swear the only thing that matters, matters to me... (The only thing that matters is your love...)
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby! (Baby, baby, baby, darlin'...)
'Cause you mean so much to me... (You mean so much, baby...)

You mean the world to me, you are my everything;
The only thing that really, really, really matters, baby... (Matters to me...)

There's a calm surrender
To the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world
Can be turned away
An enchanted moment
And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's led to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's led to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cuz you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin
ain't no crippin
ain't no punk ass niggaz set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggaz
I keep on searchin and I keep on lookin
But niggaz are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin like they evil
You don't understand about runnin with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggaz can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin
Ain't nobody worryin everybody's tryin
Nothing from nothin leaves nothin
If you wanna have somethin you better stop frontin
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by
You better be ready so you can ride

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity slide if you're living in the city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride you better be ready for the 5 rolls by

Just roll along (that's what you do)
Just roll along (that's right)
Just roll along (that's what you do)
Just roll along (that's right)

And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Well, don't hesitate,

Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday

With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine
I can see them under the pine
But don't hesitate,

Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season
But don't hesitate,
'Cause your love won't wait, just won't wait

Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday

Taking a day at a time
Dealing with feelings I don't wanna hide
Learning to love as I go, baby
Without taking you along for a ride.

Tried to find myself
Tried to find the truth
Get out from this shell
Girl I'm almost there
To show you how much I really care

If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know
That all I really (all I really) want is you (is you, baby)

Sorry if you felt misled
But I know what I feel, I know what I said, baby
God I hope you believe, believe in all that we can be
The future in us together in love.

You're the reason I'm strong (you're the reason)
Don't you think I don't know
This is where I belong
Give me the time
To say that you're mine, to say that you're mine.

Whenever I'm weary
From the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness
When my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever, I will be your man

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever, I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there
Reaching out to touch you, reaching to the stars

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever, I will be your man
Now and forever, I will be your man

Hit it

This ain't no disco
And it ain't no country club either
This is L.A.

All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me outta nowhere

It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life

And we are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash

And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars
On their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing
As best they can
In skirts and suits

They drive their
Shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company
The record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud

And he shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match
In an over-sized pack
Letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
He's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise, the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God of
Sex and drums and rock 'n' roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I'm watching you dance and the thunder rolls

And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
And I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

But I'll never stop dreaming of you
Every night of my life, no way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Will you raise me up? Will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this god forsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that
Oh, I can do that

Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?

I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

Now, I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I've got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot, ha?
Will you take me places I've never known?

Now, I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

After awhile you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on

I won't do that
I won't do that

I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around

I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

This song's dedicated to my homies
In that gangsta lean
Why'd you have to go so soon

It seems like yesterday
We were hanging round the hood
Now I'm gonna keep your memories alive
Like a homie should

A life time of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep stepping
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my forty to your memory
Take a drink and I start to think
And I, I know one day soon we'll be
We'll be hanging out

This is for my homies
(This is for my homies, well, well)
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean

This is for my homies
(This is for my homies, well)
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean

My God, my God
Would you pass on a message for me
Ha, tell him, put down those
Dice for a second, Lord
Listen to his homie

Could you tell him
I'll never let go of his memory
So his son will know
You don't have to cry no more
Cause God's got his back
I said God's got his back

A lifetime of memories
(Lifetime of memories)
Going down the drain
(Going down the drain)

I'd like to keep stepping
(I would, oh, no)
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my forty to your memory
Take a drink and I start to think
And I, I know one day soon we'll be
We'll be hanging out

This is for my homies
(This is for my homies)
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean

This is for my homies
(You know I miss you)
(You know I miss you, my homies)
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean

This song is dedicated to my homies
In that gangsta lean
Tommy from Master's Touch
My boy, EB and my boy, Ebeer

And whoever else out there that
Got a homie that's in a gangsta lean
And also, my boys in the pen
That ain't never gonna see the street again

Cause you know what
It don't matter what they was
Doing while they was here
They coulda been banging, slanging
But they ain't here no more

Now somebody's dead
Somebody's baby
That's somebody's homie
So go on and let em rest in peace
While they in that gansta lean
You know what I'm saying
That's on the real low

This is for my homies
(I can't believe that you're gone)
See you when I get there
(I'll see you, I'll see you)
(I'll see you)

This is for my homies
(Now that you're in that gangsta lean)
(Well, well, well, well)
See you when I get there
(I'm so sorry you're gone
But I've got to keep on)

This is for my homies
(I gotta keep on)
(I gotta keep moving)
(Moving, moving, moving)

See you when I get there
(I'll see you, I'll see you
One day, someday...

Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, and try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring, a telephone
Love is an angel, disguised as lust
Here in our beds until the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep,
With doubt the vicious circle turns, and burns
Without you, oh I cannot live,
Forgive the yearning burning
I believe it's time to heal to feel,
So take me now
Take me now
Take me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers

Ladies and Gentlemen
As you know we have something special down here at Birdland this evening
A recording for Blue Note Records

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, funky funky)
How 'bout a big hand now (wa-wait a minute)

Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance
As we dip in the melodic sea
Rhythm keeps flowin', drip's the MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks
Pop you don't stop til the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as I stick and move
Every poem's recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floatin' like a butterfly
Notes that I float, sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya, dip trip, flip fantasia

Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip-hop
Drippin' in your dome makes you zone and bop
Funk and fusion a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm ya cruisin'
Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless you've got to get down
Fantasy freak through the beat so unique
You move your feet and sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhyme some will call me a poet
Poem steady flowin', growin' showin' sights and sounds
Caught in the groove in the tale I found
Many tripped the tour upon the rhymes they saw
To an infinite height, to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go, off I take ya, dip trip, flip fantasia

Jump to the jam, boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhymin' on the mic I'll bring the suckers to disaster
Boukou ducks but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I fix the funky words into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, verbs manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia, dip trip, flip fantasia

Ow, you don't stop
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Give me more of that funky horn (what's that)
(Yeah, funky funky)

Bidi-bidi-bop, bidi-bidi-bop (funky funky)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that)
Bidi-bidi-bop (yeah)

And you don't know how much I'd give or how much I can take

Just to reach you

Giving away promises I know that I can't keep
Nothing fills the blackness that has seeped into my chest
I need you in my blood I am forsaking all the rest

Just to reach you

Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Babies in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Savin' all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park

Ban all the music with a phoney gas chamber

One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing

You give for free

Later on that day
My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'
And I'll be

Chorus

Rollin down the street, smokin endo, sippin on gin and juice (beeotch!!)
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin endo, sippin on gin and juice (beeotch!!)

I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
Oh, brother, are you gonna leave me wasting away
On the streets of Philadelphia?

I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I, my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin

The night has fallen and I'm lying awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me, brother, with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia?

The freaks would ya move ya pretty a-ass

The getto jam is about to slam
With some notes from the diggady d-de
As I key what's really goin' on
Would ya reminisce with me-e

Saturday morning just gettin' up
With a hangover smellin' like a fuck
I really can't remember 'cause I'm still kinda faded
So I close my eyes and thank God that I made it

Now I'm gettin' flashbacks of some O.J.
With a green glass, that's tangere
Took it to the hand gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a trick so I can handle my business

What do you know, a freak's in my reach
Threw her on the flo', stuck it in her deep
She's screamin' and she's screamin' and she's screamin', gettin' horse
But then I busted her gut, and that was that, so kick the chorus

Here we go, here we go as the tune starts to bloom

My homies are down, chillin' in the hood
Got them hootchies, well they ain't no good
To the other man, well she might be some good cat
But the homies in the hood label her as a hood rat

She's standing there
So those with game can dare
And ooh, she'll pound that ass real fast
If it ain't that big

And when your in that thing
She'll make the homies sing
Dubabwaa, dubabwaa, dubabwaa
But you don't hear me doe

Ain't nuthin' wrong with being a Trojan man
When ya ridin'
So let's kick the chorus please
If ya like it

Here we go, here we go as the tune starts to bloom
With a phat phat track pumpin' gas

My homies crowding in this dope yellow Chevy
2:03 to be prox
Ken was kickin' that funk in the trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah

Rollin' down the shore, guess what we saw
Some hootchies
They're fine as wine, is doggin' me
She's showing booty

So I approached the freak of the week
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she toted around
Well I offered a backpack

And since I'm a mack
Well, you know how the story goes
So all ya bros, freaks ya know
Here we go

Here we go, here we go as the tune starts to bloom

I miss you
I'm talking to you baby
I miss you

We used to talk,
And laugh all night girl
What happened to those days?
Did they all just fade away
Holding you in my arms
Made me feel so happy
Then you said you had to go
What's wrong, baby, I need to know

But now it's a dream
(Now it's a dream)
That I wish you could come
Back and make come true
(Come back to make come true)
But you're long gone away
(Come on back baby)
But now I'm missing you
(I miss you, yes I do,
from the bottom of my heart)

I miss you (oh yes I do)

I miss you (oh)
I'm talking to you, baby
(I'm talking to you)
I miss you (only to you, baby)

I thought you'd be with me forever
But I guess someone took my place
Took the place of me loving you,
and making love to you all through the night
I wish you were still here,
So I can see your pretty face again
Please come back and rescue me
From all this pain and misery

But now it's a dream

And I wish you
Could come back to make us true

I really miss you
I'll do anything in this world
to have you back again
Missing you
(I miss you)
Missing you
(Hey, hey, hey I do)
I miss you through winter, spring,
The summer & the fall
When we were together (Oh, yea)

I miss you, I miss you.
From the bottom of my heart
To the depths of my soul, baby
I miss you, oh
Give me the love back baby

Everytime I lay at night, all I do is cry
I do love you baby.

I miss you (yes I do, yes I do)

Chorus:
What I need from you is understanding,
how can we communicate
if you don't hear what I say,
What I need from you is understanding
so simple as one, two, three,
Understanding is what we need.

You don't even know me
you just wanna do what you wanna do
that's not the way it should be, no
You should listen to me (you should listen to me boy)
I try so very hard
to make you understand
but the choices you make
Baby, they're all demands.

Bridge:
I try so very hard
to keep our love alive
but you dont want to meet me half way
then the understandings dies
There's no way that we can work it out
if we dont pull together
I dont mean to be demanding
but I want some understanding
I want to be with you

Chorus

I listen to you baby
and I know the things your going through
I try to understand
that's why i'm still with you baby ( still with you)
see everyday we're living
and that way we'll always be unsure
that's why I need you baby
plead you baby
Please let our love endure.

Can I get in where I fit in, sit in, listen
Let me conversate better yet regulate
Shake the spot with my knot, may fade
Cuz I don't like to dream about getting paid
I played ball through the halls of C-I-S
with Snoop Dogg's big brother, call him Dirty Left
Rack 'em up, crack 'em up, stack 'em up against the gate
The homies tryin' to catch me but they can't. Wait
Damn, the street lights just came on
And my momma's on the streets tellin' me to come home
I hit the gate and I hops on my Schwinn
And I tell the homies, "aiight then", yeah

Chorus x2

Verse two, now what the fuck i do?
Catch the bus to Cal State or chill with the Voltron crew
And make a few ends on the side
Here comes a baby blue van, time to ride
So i hops in the van with my nigga Tick
And Baby Poppa, back then, that was my click
We groovin' to Santa Ana
and we plan on makin' hellafied 'mount of money hell yeah
And what I did for extra fees
Was break niggaz after work playin' get like me

Just a young mutha fucka eatin' Valupacks
Shootin' dice in the corners of the public schools

Little somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine

Verse One:

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up

Chorus

Ooooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooooh child things are gonna get brighter

Ooooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooooh child things are gonna get brighter

Verse Two:

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains and pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
there ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

Chorus

Verse Three:

And uhh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't fall down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
I'm still tryin to hold on to survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
please... you got to keep your head up

I never meant to lie to you
But I needed me an easy way out
I couldn't face the truth with you
Because I didn't want to lose my clout
I always have been good to you
Girl I promise you that nothing has changed
Momentary insanity
Must be the reason why I did you that way

So now I'm telling everybody
That I know I was a fool
To take a chance of losing
And girl I can't take losing you

So I'm
Never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No I'm
Never keeping secrets
Girl I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

I didn't want to lie to you
But I didn't want to let you down
It never did occur to me
Sooner or later that you would find out
You know how much I care for you
And I would never want to cause you pain
I know that there is no excuse
How could I ever treat my baby that way

That's why I'm telling everybody
That I know I was a fool
But I don't give a damn about it
'Cause I wanna get back wit you

(HOOK)

If you wanna go
I want you to know
Girl that I understand it
But I don't recommened it
'Cause I love you more
I know you can't ignore
That I will die for you
And lay down my life for you
Girl I wanna see
You standing next to me
Girl I apologize
For each and every lie
I want you to be

Every man wants a woman,
Where him and her can just go hang.
Just the two of them alone, kick back,
Doing their own thing.
And every man wants a woman,
That can always keep him in the mood.
And I'm that kind of girl,
So this is what I tell my dude.

(Chorus:)
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.
(Repeat x2)

(Verse Two (Kandi):)
Every man wants a woman,
That can cook him up a good meal.
A woman he can treat like his homie,
And take her out on the Ave. and just chill.
Every man wants a woman,
That ain't good for just laying on her back.
(LaTocha):And I'm that kind of woman,
(Kandi):So before me and my man get in the sack...

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.

Let me know, let me know
Ah - ha, let me know, let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know

There are times when I find
You wanna  keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength; I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know...

When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began

But if you feel, boy, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say,
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know...

Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
Make believe, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world (Look beyond your world)
Try and find a place for me (Try and find, find a place for me)
Cause...

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know...

Let me know, let me know, let me know

You can't run away forever
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start
You want to shut out the night, you want to shut down the sun
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart

Think of how we'd lay down together
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs

I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it

I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid and you're completly amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do
(Keep on believing and you'll discover, baby)

There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through

The beat is yours forever(the beat is yours forever)
The beat is always true(true)
And when you really really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through for you

Once upon a time was a backbeat
Once upon a time all the chords came to life
And the angels had guitars even before thay had wings
If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night
Get you through the night)

I treasure your love(treasure your love)
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it

I treasure your love(treasure your love)
I want to show you how to use it

And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
You're never alone 'cause you can put on the phones
And let the drummer tell your heart what to do
(Keep on believing and you'll discover, baby)

There's always something magic(there's always something magic)
There's always something new(new)

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
And there were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through
The pain

When I lost my grip
And I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave, but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired
Of livin' a lie
I was wishin' that I
Would die

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light
Ohh, it's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
Yeah, it's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay
Alive

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light
Ohh, it's amazing

Ohh, it's amazing

Kick that ol' robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!!

Just like Uniblab, robotic kickin' flab
My flavor be the badder chitter-chatter, madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you, my shit come out fatter
I got the data to turn your body into antimatter (body into antimatter)
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between (take 'em down, Mack)
The King is what I mean, I mean, my man
Get a cup and put some change inside your hand (take 'em down, Mack)
Now hold up, let's make this official (make it official)
Everybody let's agree, that M.C.'s need a tissue (wake 'em up)
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you and I bet the Mack take off like an M.X. missile
No more of your whining on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kickin' out more harder than a diamond (harder than a diamond)
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say Craig Mack with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear (KICK IT DOWN!)

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (brand new flava in ya ear)
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear (boy)

Craig Mack 1000 degrees
You'll be on your knees and you'll be burnin', beggin' please
Brother freeze! (BOY!) Man's indisputed and deep-rooted
Funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad M.C. with stamina like Bruce Jenner the winner
Tasting M.C.'s for dinner
You're crazy like that glue (you're crazy, boy, You're crazy.)
To think that you could out-do my one-two that's sick like the flu (shake 'em down, Mack)
Boy, I flip boy all the time
'Cause boy, the rhyme you're kickin' ain't worth a dime (HAAAAAAAAA! BOY!)
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position (knock 'em out!)
No flav could ever dig a grave for the Mack
The power pack in black makin' cement crack (make it crack)
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (Here- comes- the- brand- new- flavor-
Time for new flava in ya ear (in- your- ear-)
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear (BOY!!!)
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear (Flavor down)
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (Flavor, Flavor ...)
Time for new flava in ya ear (here comes the flavor)
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear (Flavor in ya ear, boy)

Haaa! The Mack is dope
With more hope than the Pope, but for M.C.'s more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down down-breakin' forsaken
Lords of M.C.'s shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
M.C.'s will run like a bomb threat
I bet (what?) or better yet (huh?) make you sweat
Gettin' hotter than the sun get (yup!)
Craig Mack is the flav that romps from here to Tibet (BOY!)
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to M.C.'s stop relaxin'
This brand new sheriff that's in town
's gettin' down, leavin' bodies buried in the ground (rest in peace)
I set up rhymes for a decoy
To off a bad boy (OOOhhhh!) Watch the M.C.'s I destroy and (BOY!!)

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (time for new flavor)
Time for new flava in ya ear (fla-VOR!!)
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear (time for the flav)
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear (boy, here comes the Mack)
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (HAAAAAA! wakin' up with some flavor!!)
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

(uh)U-N-I-T-Y
U-N-I-T-Y (That's a unity)
U-N-I-T-Y
Love a black man from infinity to infinity
who're you a calling a bitch?

Chrous:
U-N-I-T-Y(you gotta let em know)
U-N-I-T-Y (That's a unity)(come on here we go)
U-N-I-T-Y (you gotta let em know)
Another black woman from infinity to infinity
(you ain't a bitch or a hoe)

U-N-I-T-Y(you gotta let em know)
U-N-I-T-Y (That's a unity)(come on here we go)
U-N-I-T-Y (you gotta let em know)
Another black woman from infinity to infinity
(you ain't a bitch or a hoe)

Instinct leads me to another flow
Everytime I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said (Yeah me bitch) and laughed
Since he was with his boys he tried to break fly
(Huh) I punched him dead in his eye and said
"Who you calling a bitch?"

Chorus (2x)

I hit the bottle There ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work and they gave you an attitude
then you were rough
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you ain't that sick? (Who you calling a bitch?)

Chorus

What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head and you
Call yourself a "Gangsta Bitch" now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wilding, acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe...hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type (yeah)
Ain't none of this worth getting your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
(Bucking with nobody)
She got to wear that for life (Who you calling a bitch?)

Da da, da da

Ah, ho-oo-oh-oo

Fearless people,
Careless needle.
Harsh words spoken,
And lives are broken.

Forceful ageing,
Help me I'm fading.
Heaven's waiting,
It's time to move on.

Crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
Life carries on... it goes on.

Just say die,
And that would be pessimistic.
In your mind,
We can walk across the water.
Please don't cry,
It's just a prayer for the dying.
I just don't know what's got into me.

Been crossin' that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
...learned...

Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
...burned burned...

I may not know what you're going through,
But time is the space,
Between me and you.

There is a light through that window
...light through that window...
Hold on say yes, while people say no

Life carries on
...on on on...
Ohh!
It goes on....oh-ee-oh, whoa-ee-oh ho oh...

I'm crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned....
I'm playing with fire,
And not getting burned....
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
There is a light through that window.
Hold on say yes, while people say no

'Cause life carries on...oh-ee-oh, whoa-ee-oh ho on...
It goes on....oh-ee-on,
It goes on.
Whoah.
Whoah.
Life carries on.

When nothing else matters.

When nothing else matters.

I just don't know what's got into me.

It's just a prayer for the dying.
...dying dying dying dying...

For the dying.

I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry (everyday...)
Yes everyday I fall (everyday...)
Do you ever wonder why (everyday...)
why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try
to make my heart be still
'til then every way there is to cry
ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by (everyday...)
And everyday I fall (everyday...)
It makes me wonder why (everyday...)
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'cos every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away (everyday...)
Try, try, try as I may (everyday...)
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'til then every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

Everyday, everyday you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishin', when he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate, holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go, but someday you'll change your mind

And Johnny said
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson, take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl, ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in, front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun, grabbed her by the arm
Said if you do what I tell you to there, won't be any harm

And Johnny said
Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me, here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl, five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she, says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine, but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast and, Johnny hit his knees

And there he prayed
Take the very, breath you gave me, take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me, make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please, don't take the girl

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old

Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Heavy D]
I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kind of digging me
But every time you see me
word is born, you be ignoring me

I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me

But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
And catch you the next day

When I'm in focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you

I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low pro-file type

I always thought you
Was a rah rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama

What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one

I want to know cause if I don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me

[Chorus -sung]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Heavy D]
I'm steady, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from

The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
And I want some

So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A brother to get got
I'm not your man

But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me

I got to hear it from your girls, Uptown
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the Boogie Down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me

I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet

Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Chorus -sung]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Heavy D]
"Hey, yo, hey, yo...."
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
"Hey, yo, hey, yo...."
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party

I never stumble cause I'm humble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped

But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away
Emotional trips
Get a grip
Because I'm losing it
Ideas was clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it

I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already

But I'm a put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide

Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Chorus -sung 4X to fade]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night

Got a funny feeling when she walked in the room

Spinning my head around and taking my body under

Drug me around by my head band

This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up

It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up

I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Intro:

Jerome! jerome! put on that bobby womack!
Nah girl I wanna go way back, ahh yeah check this out
*needle is put to the groove on a dusty record*

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days

Verse one:

When I just a little niggerole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go taggin along
Naggin if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggaz singin the blues
That be always tryin to bag with the shag (and karate shoes)
Sayin "yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that"
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungaloes
Then switch to playin ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearin gazelles
If they really had money raised be sportin bk's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminesce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Chorus:

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
(and everybody say)		  (I remember way back when)
(and everybody say)		 (I remember way back when)
(and everybody say) 	   (I remember way back when)
(what? )  (back in the day)	 (when? )  (back in the day)

Verse two:

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blow up)
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)


But let me finish this reminescin and tellin
Bout when girls was bellin tight courderoys like for the boys
Basket weaves, nike court airs, and footsie socks
And eatin pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad 'cause when j.j. fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies, had poison airbrushes on they asses
Dudes, had on nike suits, and the pumas with
The fat laces, 'cause it was either that or k-swiss
I miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishin all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminesce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Chorus

(and everybody say)		(I remember way back when)
(and everybody say)		   (I remember way back when)
(and everybody say)		 (I remember way back when)
(what? )	(back in the day)  (when? )	(back in the day)

Verse three:

Well, it's the niggerole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holdin
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbin
You steady bobbin your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in south central l.a.
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So (ahmad and the jones' is on our way up)
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but
Sometimes I still sit and reminesce, then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Chorus

(and everybody say) 	   (I remember way back when)
(and everybody say)		  (I remember way back when)
(and everybody say)		(I remember way back when)
(what? )  (back in the day)  (when? )  (back in the day)

(and everybody say)		   (I remember way back when)
(and everybody say)		  (I remember way back when)
(and everybody say)		 (I remember way back when)
(what? )	(back in the day)  (when? )	(back in the day)

Rainy night, I'm all alone
Sittin here waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns
To cold, cold sweat thinkin about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now
I gotta know, do you feel the same?
Do you just light up at the mention of my name?

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin new
That's just love sneakin up on you
And if your whole work is shakin, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin up on you

Hey heyyy yea

Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneakin up on your blind side
You might as well
Try to stop the rain
Stand in the track of a runaway train
Just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be yea
Come on let's finish what you started with me
Yeeaahhh

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin new
That's just love sneakin up on you
And if your whole work is shakin, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin up on you

Heeey yea

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin new
That's just love sneakin up on you
And if your whole work is shakin, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin up on you

98@Babyface@And Our Feelings
@@@
We fell in love
And who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
Now they wonder
Why we didn't last

We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder
Love came to an end

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared
They didn't help
Makes me wonder
Should we blame ourselves

So here we are
Broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves
When everybody said to let it end
It makes me wonder
We can't let them win

HOOK

If we'd only just try we could make it by
And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we shoulda done
We'd both be here still making love
I wanna know that, that we can go back
Back to the times when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love

Verse 1: Ice Cube
1993, much more ba-e-ya-e-younce
Ice Cube comin' with the half ounce
Not Just Knee Deep, jeep fulla smog
A, To, mic, Dog
Like ya behind, heard it through the grapevine
How much longer will you be mine?
And I'ma tell ya, I don't like drama
So do I have to put my handcuffs on your mama
'Cause Bertha Butt did her fuckin' boogie with her crew
But I'd rather fuck you, boo
And make you say humdrum, tweedee dum
Humdrum don't succumb when I'm done, buckin' shit
One nation under a groove gettin down for the fuck of it
Tear the roof of this motherfucker like we did last night, son
And hit you with the bop gun

(Clinton)
Here's my chance to dance my way
Out of my constriction
Gonna be freakin' up and down
Hang up really late
The groove I only got
We shall all be moved
Ready or not, here we come
Gettin down for the one which we believe in
(One nation under a groove
Gettin down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin can stop us now)


{Yeah.}
Dance, sucka, dance!

{Yeah, heh heh.  And it don't stop.  Sheeeit.}

Givin' you more of what you're funkin' for

Gettin down on the one which we believe in)

Verse 2: Ice Cube
If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys
Playin with our toys
M-1, cuz everybody's gotta have fun
Under the sun, under the sun
So rough, so tough when I get down
The disco fiend with the monster sound
I wants to get fucked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill-in
You let her funk me 'cause my funk is the best
Comin from the West
Kickin that shit be occupied, dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin them dips, cd skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that
If it's rough, make the girls say
"Do that stuff! Aw, do that stuff!"
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun

Gettin down just for the funk of it

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo bitch go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got Daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale
Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the Black Hole
Now I'll big bang you with my black pole
Flashlight, red light, we don't like cops on the bike
Just made bail, tonight
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna have some fun with the bop gun

(verse 1)
I would like to get to know if I could be
the kind of girl that you could be down for,
'Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me;
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

And if I don't let you know, then I won't be for real
I could be wrong, but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true,
There ain't no other, for me there's only you

(Chorus)

I wanna be down, with what you're going through
I wanna be down, i wanna be down with you
No matter the time, of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

(verse 2)

I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact, then I'll be more than you ever could dream of

If all you need is the time, that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love, until you call me baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to call you up
And let you know everthing will be alright

(chorus x2 )

Yeah oh
Yeah, oh
